HNSCC Single-Cell Atlas: Decoding Tumor Microenvironments One Cell at a Time

Welcome to the HNSCC Single-Cell Mapping Project, where we dive deep into the cellular world of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This project uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to understand what makes tumor and non-tumor cells different—and what we might do with that knowledge.

This isn’t just a casual look at data. It's a step-by-step journey toward identifying targets that could eventually help with DNA vaccine development or better treatment decisions. Everything here is done openly and simply so others can learn, build, or collaborate.

Project Overview

This project uses real scRNA-seq data to:

Tell cancer cells from non-cancer cells

Compare their gene activity

Visualize how they cluster and differ

Explore possible genes that could be targeted in therapy

Recreate and build on the open dataset shared by Puram et al. (2017)

Data Source and Credit

This work is possible thanks to the open data from:

Puram et al., Cell (2017):

Step-by-Step Plan

✅ Phase 1: Setup and Visualization

Load the scRNA-seq data file (annotated matrix)

Separate expression from metadata

Add labels to say which cells are cancer and which are not

Normalize the gene counts

Log-transform and reduce data with UMAP

Plot gene expression (e.g. EPCAM, SPP1) across cells

🔄 Phase 2: Find Key Genes

Run statistical tests to find genes that differ between cancer and non-cancer cells

Plot top genes using dot plots and heatmaps

Create gene lists for further research

🧠 Phase 3: Link to Real Biology

Search for genes related to immunity or stemness

Use public databases to learn more about those genes

Suggest possible vaccine targets based on results

🌐 Phase 4: Share the Project (Future)

Build a basic app with Streamlit or Dash

Let users search and visualize by gene or cell type

Publish the results for everyone to explore

Why This Project?

This project started from a simple goal: learn and build something real with single-cell data. The HNSCC tumor microenvironment is complex. By breaking it down one cell at a time, we aim to:

Understand the tumor better

Practice reproducible bioinformatics

Open the door to hypothesis generation and future lab work

Environment and Requirements

Python Version

Python 3.13 (but 3.10+ is just fine)

Key Libraries

Install with pip:

pip install scanpy pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Or with conda:

conda install -c bioconda scanpy

Example Outputs

UMAPs colored by cancer status

Violin plots showing marker expression

Lists of genes differentially expressed in cancer

Clean .h5ad file to reuse later

How to Follow Along

This is an open, evolving project. New results and plots will be shared often. You can:

Watch the repo for updates

Fork and try it yourself

Suggest new genes or analysis directions

Help annotate or interpret findings
